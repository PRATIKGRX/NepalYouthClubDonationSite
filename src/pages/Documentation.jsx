            <p className="">
              The Gen-Z demonstration in Nepal in 2025 was the culmination of
              years of quiet resentment among a generation weary of nepotism,
              corruption, and unfulfilled promises. One of the biggest youth-led
              movements in contemporary Nepali history quickly emerged from what
              started as online discussions about inequality and "nepo babies,"
              the affluent offspring of politicians and elites who inherited
              power without merit. This demonstration was about dignity,
              justice, and a shared call for accountability, not just a platform
              or a policy.

              Background: The Rise of the Nepo-Baby Trend and Growing Discontent
            </h4>
            <p>
              Young people in Nepal were using social media to express their
              rage months before the streets were crowded with banners and
              chants. Inspired by discussions about privilege around the world,
              the "Nepo Baby" movement became a rallying cry in Nepal against
              generational inequality and political favoritism. Young artists,
              students, and influencers started to reveal how friends and family
              of those in positions of authority were frequently given
              government jobs, contracts, and positions. Millions of views and
              comments on TikTok, Instagram, and X (Twitter) reflected the
              widespread sentiment that "we are educated, capable, and
              hardworking, but we are invisible in our own country." It was only
              the tip of the iceberg. Deep-seated resentment over inflation,
              unemployment, poor leadership, and the absence of accountability
              in public institutions was underneath it. Many Gen-Z Nepalis
              believed that political leaders had become disconnected from the
              realities of common people, that corruption went unpunished, and
              that their voices were consistently ignored. The "nepo baby"
              discussions turned into a mirror reflecting all of the system's
              flaws, and for the first time, a generation made the decision to
              speak out.

            <p>
              As conversations evolved into coordinated calls for action, the
              movement gathered steam in the middle of 2025. Instead of
              political parties, youth organizations, neighborhood clubs, and
              independent activists started organizing nonviolent protests
              calling for justice, reform, and transparency.By early September,
              there was a palpable energy in the air in big cities like
              Biratnagar, Pokhara, and Kathmandu. There were posters everywhere
              that said things like "We Deserve Better," "Stop Corruption," and
              "No More Nepotism." The situation worsened when officials ignored
              the mounting annoyance and, in certain instances, attempted to
              stifle online debates. What had begun as nonviolent assemblies of
              professionals and students swiftly escalated into a national
              revolution.

            <p>
              In the beginning, there was a surge of youth meetings in city
              squares, colleges, and schools. What started out as casual
              conversations about corruption and nepotism turned into planned
              demonstrations. Students created banners that said, "Justice for
              the People" and "No to Nepotism." Videos, songs, and posters
              advocating for nonviolent protests were all over social media.
              Coordination was impromptu even in the absence of a central
              leader, demonstrating Gen-Z's capacity for emotional and digital
              mobilization.

              September 8: The First Major Demonstrations And The MAIN Day
            </h4>
            <p>
              An important day in Nepal's recent history was September 8, 2025,
              when Gen-Z youth staged a sizable protest to call for equality,
              accountability, and transparency. Students, recent graduates,
              young professionals, activists, and members of the community from
              all over the Kathmandu Valley participated in the protest, which
              got underway in the morning at Maitighar Mandala in Kathmandu.
              With banners and placards addressing issues like systemic
              inequality, nepotism, and corruption, they gathered.
            </p>
            <p>
              Using chants and public declarations to express their concerns,
              the participants kept a well-coordinated and orderly presence.
              Criticizing the disproportionate advantages enjoyed by children of
              political and economic elites, many emphasized the "nepo baby"
              phenomenon. Broader youth demands for equitable governance,
              merit-based opportunities, and greater involvement in national
              decision-making processes were also highlighted during the
              demonstration.
            </p>
            <p>
              The day's original plan was meticulously planned: the
              demonstrators would march from Maitighar Mandala to mid-Baneshwor
              and back, representing the never-ending cycle of youth tenacity
              and fortitude. To guarantee safety, organizers worked with
              neighborhood organizations to plan the route, and numerous
              volunteers were positioned along the route to offer assistance,
              water, and first aid. A celebration of youth power through
              coordinated, symbolic action, the atmosphere was upbeat, resolute,
              and serene.
            </p>
            <p>
              But as the march got underway, it became evident that the crowd's
              size far surpassed expectations. The procession naturally
              stretched farther than mid-Baneshwor as tens of thousands of
              people poured into the streets and crowded the planned route. An
              unexpected detour from the original plan occurred when a huge,
              unstoppable wave of protesters arrived in the vicinity of the
              federal parliament by late morning. A large gathering of young
              voices at the center of national power replaced what had been
              intended to be a controlled, symbolic march.
            </p>
            <p>
              Tensions started to rise at the parliament. Unprepared for the
              magnitude and ferocity of the crowd, authorities made an effort to
              reroute demonstrators back to Maitighar Mandala. Seeing the
              parliament as the symbolic epicenter of the corruption and
              nepotism they were opposing, many young participants declined. The
              protest reached a crucial, tense stage as the crowd's enthusiasm,
              enhanced by chants, songs, and banners, became practically
              tangible.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sadly, what started out as a nonviolent protest turned into a
              run-in with the law. Journalists and witnesses described
              horrifying act
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc md:ml-10 ml-5 sm:ml-6 flex flex-col md:gap-6 sm:gap-4 gap-2">
              <li>
                During the march, children wearing school uniforms were shot, a
                startling infraction that was widely denounced. These kids had
                been dressed symbolically to draw attention to the unfairness
                and lack of opportunities being denied to the next generation.
              </li>
              <li>
                When protesters attempted to keep the injured inside the
                ambulance, police shot through them and hid inside them the
                ambulances for a planned shoot out.
              </li>
              <li>
                Despite the terror caused by tear gas, rubber bullets, and even
                live ammunition, many protesters persisted in singing, chanting,
                and supporting one another. Pictures of young people joining
                arms, protecting younger participants, and carrying injured
                friends went viral on social media and came to symbolize the
                movement.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Protesters improvised throughout the day. On the sidewalks were
              improvised first-aid stations. Younger participants were led
              through smoke-filled streets by senior students and volunteers who
              taught them how to stay safe and make their voices heard. Songs
              that represented the movement's unwavering spirit continued to
              reverberate, a blend of grief, rage, and hope.
            </p>
            <p>
              Reports by late afternoon suggested that a number of demonstrators
              had either been killed or seriously wounded. There was a startling
              contrast between chaos and resolve as panic spread in some places
              while other groups remained disciplined and carried on with their
              chants and songs. Photographers captured scenes that would later
              become iconic symbols of Nepalese youth protest, street murals
              were painted on the spot, and slogans written in chalk and paint
              preserved the day's events.
            </p>
            <p>
              The crowd did not completely disperse as the day came to an end.
              While smaller groups stayed overnight, holding vigils, singing
              songs, and lighting candles for the dead and injured, many people
              made their way back to Maitighar Mandala as scheduled. September 8
              came to represent not only opposition to the government but also
              the moral bravery, inventiveness, and tenacity of Nepali youth.
            </p>
            <p>
              The protesters' songs, chants, and peaceful intent resonated
              outside of Kathmandu, inspiring solidarity in other cities and
              rural areas despite the tragic events and deadly force. On
              September 8, 2025, Gen-Z made their loudest and most visible
              demand for accountability, not through violence but through unity,
              culture, and resolve.
            </p>
            <p>
              It had a serious effect on people. Witnessing violence during the
              protest left many students traumatized, and in certain cases,
              families experienced irreversible loss, with mothers and other
              family members never seeing their children again. Nevertheless,
              throughout the day, demonstrators persisted in voicing their
              demands and supporting one another.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to being a tragic period in Nepal's history, September
              8, 2025, is remembered as a crucial day for youth mobilization. In
              addition to highlighting the dire repercussions of state violence,
              it showed how determined young people were to demand
              accountability and change. The incidents made clear how urgently
              systemic changes must be made, peaceful protesters must be
              protected, and the long-term psychological and social effects on
              those directly impacted must be considered.
